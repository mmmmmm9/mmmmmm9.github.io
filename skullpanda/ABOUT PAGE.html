熊喵：When I designed Skullpanda,
<br>
I designed it with the mindset of "this is the other me", 
<br>
but that doesn't mean I want to be Skullpanda.
<br>
<br>
The design of Skullpanda may bring in my perceptions and
<br>
exploration of some stories in my life,
<br> 
which are complementary to the expression of my spirituality.
<br>
<br>
Skullpanda is set as a girl with a personality that can
<br> 
travel freely in the universe.
<br>
It has the helmet of an astronaut and spherical braids.
<br> 
I hope it will be bold and self-explanatory enough to have
<br>
the opportunity to experience all kinds of life
<br> 
and encounter exciting or bumpy stories.
